# Refactor

## Setup

Install ruby dependencies

```
    $ bundle install
```

Open the project in Sublime 

```
    $ subl .
```

## Goal

You have been assigned to clean up some legacy (existing) code. The former programmer quit the company without leaving any documentation or tests! Write tests for the methods, then use those tests to refactor. Your final code should be maintainable, easy to understand, self-documenting, and well tested.


## Testing

Run the entire test suite

```
    $ ruby utilities_test.rb
```

Run only a specific test

```
    $ ruby utilities_test.rb --name type_test_method_name_here
```
